Ingredients:

A round baking tin of 24 cm (9.5 inches) 
225 g soft butter (1 cup), at room temperature
225 g (1 ⅛ cups) of granulated sugar
4 eggs, at room temperature
1 tsp vanilla extract
1 tsp lemon zest
2 tsp lemon juice
275 g (2 ¼ cups) gluten-free flour mix (I use Schär Mix It Universal)
16 g baking powder
300 g (2 cups) blueberries (I used frozen blueberries, do not defrost beforehand)
A pinch of salt

Recipe steps:

1. Preheat the oven to 160 degrees Celsius (320 F).

2. Line a 24 cm (9.5 inches) round baking tin with baking paper and grease the sides with a little butter.

3. Mix the butter and the sugar until creamy with a mixer.

4. Add the vanilla extract and eggs one at a time, mixing every time in between.

5. Add the lemon zest and lemon juice.

6. Put the flour, baking powder, and salt in another bowl and mix together.

7. Add this little by little to the wet ingredients while continuing to mix until you have a smooth batter.

8. Gently stir the blueberries into the batter. If you use frozen blueberries, don’t defrost them in advance, but stir them frozen through the batter.

9. Pour the mixture into the baking tin and use a spatula to smooth it out.

10. Bake the cake in the oven for 60 minutes. Keep a close eye on the cake while baking, if the cake darkens too quickly, you can cover it with some baking paper. After about 50 minutes, check whether the cake is ready. The cake is done when a skewer comes out clean.

11. Remove the cake from the oven and let it cool in the tin for a few minutes. Then take it out of the tin and let it cool completely.
