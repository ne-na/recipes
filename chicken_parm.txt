Ingredients:
100 g (3.5 oz) gluten-free flour (I use Schär Mix It Universal)
2 eggs
100 g (3.5 oz) breadcrumbs (I made this from leftover spelt bread)*
1 handful of fresh parsley
40 g (1.4 oz) parmesan cheese
½ tsp pepper
½ tsp salt
4 chicken breasts
2 tbsp olive oil
400 ml (13.5 fl. oz.) plain tomato passata
1 ball of mozzarella
280 (9.9 oz) g gluten-free pasta
A handful of fresh basil

Recipe steps:
Preheat the oven to 200 degrees Celsius (392 F).

Take 3 shallow plates. 
Put the gluten-free flour in one plate and break two eggs in the other plate. Stir together.
Divide the breadcrumbs over the third plate.
Finely chop the parsley and stir it into the breadcrumbs together with the Parmesan cheese. 
Also stir in the salt and pepper.

Place the chicken breasts flat between two sheets of cling film. 
Flatten with a rolling pin until about 1 cm (o.4 inches) thick.
Dip the chicken breasts in the flour first. Gently knock off excess flour.
Dip in the egg mixture and then place in the breadcrumbs on both sides. 
Repeat for all pieces of chicken.
