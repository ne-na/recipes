Ingredients:

An oven dish
350 g (12.3 oz) minced meat
400 ml (14.1 oz) sieved tomatoes (tomato passata)*
100 â€“ 150 ml (3.5 to 5 oz) stock (made with a low FODMAP stock cube)
1 tsp cornstarch
1 green bell pepper*
200 g (7.1 oz) carrots
200 g (7.1 oz) canned mushrooms
1 tsp Italian herbs
10 gluten-free lasagna noodles
50 g (3.5 oz) grated cheese
1 mozzarella
25 g (2 tbsp) butter
25 g (3 tbsp) gluten-free flour
300 ml (1o.1 oz) lactose-free milk
30 g (1.1 oz) grated cheese
Pepper and salt

Recipe steps:

1. Pre-heat the oven to 175 degrees Celsius (350 F)

2. Cut the carrot and the bell pepper into small pieces. Rinse the mushrooms and drain well.

3. Fry the minced meat until done. Add the vegetables and fry for a few minutes.

4. Add the sieved tomatoes and the Italian herbs and season the sauce with pepper and salt.

5. Add the stock as well. Leave the sauce to simmer for a few minutes until it thickens.

6. If the sauce stays too thin, you can bind it with a little bit of cornstarch. Put 1 tsp of cornstarch in a small bowl and add a little bit of water. Stir with a whisk until smooth. Add this to the sauce and stir well.

7. Make the white sauce by melting the butter in a pan on low heat. When the butter has melted, add the flour and stir for 2 minutes with a whisk.

8. Slowly add the milk. Continue to stir with the whisk, so you get a smooth sauce.

9. Stir 30 g of the grated cheese into the white sauce and season with salt and pepper. Leave the sauce to simmer on low heat for a few minutes, so it can thicken.

10. Take your oven dish. Put a thin layer of tomato sauce into the oven dish. Then a layer of lasagna noodles, a layer of white sauce, and finish with a little bit of grated cheese. Continue with tomato sauce and another layer of lasagna noodles. White sauce again and some grated cheese. Repeat this until you have used all noodles. I made three layers using 3 lasagna noodles at a time. End with a layer of tomato sauce.

11. Cut the mozzarella into slices and divide it over the top of the lasagna.

12. Bake the lasagna in the oven for 40 minutes. Cover the oven dish with aluminum foil after 20 minutes, otherwise, the top of the lasagna might burn.
